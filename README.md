# Oblique Projectile Motion Simulation

A simulation of oblique projectile motion, designed for an interactive and customizable user experience.

This project was independently developed as a final project to complete the **Introduction to Computer Science** course ahead of schedule during my studies.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI:**
  - Manual configuration of simulation parameters:
    - Initial speed
    - Launch angle
    - Initial height
    - Gravity acceleration
  - Real-time display of position and velocity components (`Vx`, `Vy`).
  - Visualization of the projectile's trajectory.

- **Simulation Controls:**
  - Pause, resume, or reset the simulation.
  - Toggle between a ball-following view or a static view.
  - Adjust zoom levels dynamically.

- **Advanced Customization:**
  - Personalize the appearance via a config file:
    - Background, ball, and ground colors.
    - Ball radius and tracer size.
    - Name of the statistics output file.

- **Statistics and Analysis:**
  - Final flight parameters displayed:
    - Range, max height, and time to max height.
  - Save statistics for each simulation to a specified file.
